JONES, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the\\nnight, but was too drunk to remember to shut the popholes. With the\\nring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched\\nacross the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a\\nlast glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to\\nbed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.\\nAs soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a\\nfluttering all through the farm buildings. Word had gone round during\\nthe day that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had a strange\\ndream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other\\nanimals. It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as\\nsoon as Mr. Jones was safely out of the way. Old Major (so he was\\nalways called, though the name under which he had been exhibited was\\nWillingdon Beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone\\nwas quite ready to lose an hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to\\nsay.\\nAt one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major was\\nalready ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from\\na beam. He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but\\nhe was still a majestic-looking pig, with a wise and benevolent\\nappearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut.\\nBefore long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves\\ncomfortable after their different fashions. First came the three dogs,\\nBluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the\\nstraw immediately in front of the platform.

The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking\\nvery slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest\\nthere should be some small animal concealed in the straw. Clover was a\\nstout motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got\\nher figure back after her fourth foal. Boxer was an enormous beast,\\nnearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses\\nput together. A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid\\nappearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence, but he was\\nuniversally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous\\npowers of work. After the horses came Muriel, the white goat, and\\nBenjamin, the donkey. Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm,\\nand the worst tempered. He seldom talked, and when he did, it was\\nusually to make some cynical remark-for instance, he would say that\\nGod had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner\\nhave had no tail and no flies. Alone among the animals on the farm he\\nnever laughed. If asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh\\nat.

We are born, we are given\\njust so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us\\nwho are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength;\\nand the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are\\nslaughtered with hideous cruelty. No animal in England knows the\\nmeaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year old. No animal in\\nEngland is free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the\\nplain truth.\\n\"But is this simply part of the order of nature? Is it because this land of\\nours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dwell\\nupon it? No, comrades, a thousand times no! The soil of England is\\nfertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording food in abundance\\nto an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it. This\\nsingle farm of ours would support a dozen horses, twenty cows,\\nhundreds of sheep-and all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that\\nare now almost beyond our imagining. Why then do we continue in this\\nmiserable condition? Because nearly the whole of the produce of our\\nlabour is stolen from us by human beings. There, comrades, is the\\nanswer to all our problems. It is summed up in a single word-Man. Man\\nis the only real enemy we have. Remove Man from the scene, and the\\nroot cause of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever.\\n\"Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does\\nnot give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough,\\nhe cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the\\nanimals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare\\nminimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps\\nfor himself. Our labour tills the soil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there\\nis not one of us that owns more than his bare skin. You cows that I see\\nbefore me, how many thousands of gallons of milk have you given\\nduring this last year? And what has happened to that milk which should\\nhave been breeding up sturdy calves?

The work of teaching and\\norganising the others fell naturally upon the pigs, who were generally\\nrecognised as being the cleverest of the animals. Pre-eminent among\\nthe pigs were two young boars named Snowball and Napoleon, whom\\nMr. Jones was breeding up for sale. Napoleon was a large, rather\\nfierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much\\nof a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way. Snowball was\\na more vivacious pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more\\ninventive, but was not considered to have the same depth of character.\\nAll the other male pigs on the farm were porkers. The best known\\namong them was a small fat pig named Squealer, with very round\\ncheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a shrill voice. He was a\\nbrilliant talker, and when he was arguing some difficult point he had a\\nway of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail which was\\nsomehow very persuasive. The others said of Squealer that he could\\nturn black into white.\\nThese three had elaborated old Major\\'s teachings into a complete\\nsystem of thought, to which they gave the name of Animalism. Several\\nnights a week, after Mr. Jones was asleep, they held secret meetings in\\nthe barn and expounded the principles of Animalism to the others. At\\nthe beginning they met with much stupidity and apathy. Some of the\\nanimals talked of the duty of loyalty to Mr. Jones, whom they referred\\nto as \"Master,\" or made elementary remarks such as \"Mr. Jones feeds\\nus. If he were gone, we should starve to death.\" Others asked such\\nquestions as \"Why should we care what happens after we are dead?\" or\\n\"If this Rebellion is to happen anyway, what difference does it make\\nwhether we work for it or not?\", and the pigs had great difficulty in\\nmaking them see that this was contrary to the spirit of Animalism. The\\nstupidest questions of all were asked by Mollie, the white mare. The\\nvery first question she asked Snowball was: \"Will there still be sugar\\nafter the Rebellion?\"\\n\"No,\" said Snowball firmly. \"We have no means of making sugar on\\nthis farm.

In Sugarcandy Mountain it was Sunday seven days a week, clover\\nwas in season all the year round, and lump sugar and linseed cake grew\\non the hedges.

It was lucky that the owners\\nof the two farms which adjoined Animal Farm were on permanently\\nbad terms. One of them, which was named Foxwood, was a large,\\nneglected, old-fashioned farm, much overgrown by woodland, with all\\nits pastures worn out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition.

The\\nother farm, which was called Pinchfield, was smaller and better kept.\\nIts owner was a Mr. Frederick, a tough, shrewd man, perpetually\\ninvolved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains. These\\ntwo disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them to come\\nto any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.\\nNevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion on\\nAnimal Farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from\\nlearning too much about it.

The animals lashed\\nropes round these, and then all together, cows, horses, sheep, any\\nanimal that could lay hold of the rope-even the pigs sometimes joined\\nin at critical moments-they dragged them with desperate slowness up\\nthe slope to the top of the quarry, where they were toppled over the\\nedge, to shatter to pieces below.

The horses carried it off in\\ncart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even Muriel and Benjamin\\nyoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did their share. By late\\nsummer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, and then the\\nbuilding began, under the superintendence of the pigs.\\nBut it was a slow, laborious process.

They would\\nmeet in the public-houses and prove to one another by means of\\ndiagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did\\nstand up, then that it would never work. And yet, against their will, they\\nhad developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the\\nanimals were managing their own affairs. One symptom of this was that\\nthey had begun to call Animal Farm by its proper name and ceased to\\npretend that it was called the Manor Farm. They had also dropped their\\nchampionship of Jones, who had given up hope of getting his farm back\\nand gone to live in another part of the county. Except through\\nWhymper, there was as yet no contact between Animal Farm and the\\noutside world, but there were constant rumours that Napoleon was\\nAnimal Farm by George Orwell\\nhttp://www.mudmap.com/1984/animalfarm.htm (33 of 71) [2/20/2001 10:17:44 AM]', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='Metadata:\\n{metadata_str}\\n-----\\nContent:\\n{content}'),\n",

Liberal old-age pensions had been agreed upon. As yet no animal\\nhad actually retired on pension, but of late the subject had been\\ndiscussed more and more. Now that the small field beyond the orchard\\nhad been set aside for barley, it was rumoured that a corner of the large\\npasture was to be fenced off and turned into a grazing-ground for\\nsuperannuated animals.

In the autumn the four\\nsows had all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young\\npigs between them. The young pigs were piebald, and as Napoleon was\\nthe only boar on the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage. It\\nwas announced that later, when bricks and timber had been purchased,\\na schoolroom would be built in the farmhouse garden. For the time\\nbeing, the young pigs were given their instruction by Napoleon himself\\nin the farmhouse kitchen. They took their exercise in the garden, and\\nwere discouraged from playing with the other young animals. About\\nthis time, too, it was laid down as a rule that when a pig and any other\\nanimal met on the path, the other animal must stand aside: and also that\\nall pigs, of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of wearing\\ngreen ribbons on their tails on Sundays.\\nThe farm had had a fairly successful year, but was still short of money.\\nThere were the bricks, sand, and lime for the schoolroom to be\\npurchased, and it would also be necessary to begin saving up again for\\nthe machinery for the windmill. Then there were lamp oil and candles\\nfor the house, sugar for Napoleon's own table (he forbade this to the\\nother pigs, on the ground that it made them fat), and all the usual\\nreplacements such as tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap-iron, and dog\\nbiscuits. A stump of hay and part of the potato crop were sold off, and\\nthe contract for eggs was increased to six hundred a week, so that that\\nyear the hens barely hatched enough chicks to keep their numbers at the\\nsame level. Rations, reduced in December, were reduced again in\\nFebruary, and lanterns in the stalls were forbidden to save Oil. But the\\npigs seemed comfortable enough, and in fact were putting on weight if\\nanything. One afternoon in late February a warm, rich, appetising scent,\\nsuch as the animals had never smelt before, wafted itself across the yard\\nfrom the little brew-house, which had been disused in Jones's time, and\\nwhich stood beyond the kitchen. Someone said it was the smell of\\ncooking barley. The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered\\nwhether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper.

Much of this work was of a kind that the other animals were too\\nignorant to understand. For example, Squealer told them that the pigs\\nhad to expend enormous labours every day upon mysterious things\\ncalled \"files,\" \"reports,\" \"minutes,\" and \"memoranda.\" These were large\\nsheets of paper which had to be closely covered with writing, and as\\nsoon as they were so covered, they were burnt in the furnace.

And\\nwhen they heard the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at\\nthe masthead, their hearts swelled with imperishable pride, and the talk\\nturned always towards the old heroic days, the expulsion of Jones, the\\nwriting of the Seven Commandments, the great battles in which the\\nhuman invaders had been defeated. None of the old dreams had been\\nabandoned. The Republic of the Animals which Major had foretold,\\nwhen the green fields of England should be untrodden by human feet,\\nwas still believed in. Some day it was coming: it might not be soon, it\\nmight not be with in the lifetime of any animal now living, but still it\\nwas coming. Even the tune of Beasts of England was perhaps hummed\\nsecretly here and there: at any rate, it was a fact that every animal on\\nthe farm knew it, though no one would have dared to sing it aloud. It\\nmight be that their lives were hard and that not all of their hopes had\\nbeen fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not as other\\nanimals. If they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical human\\nbeings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves. No\\ncreature among them went upon two legs. No creature called any other\\ncreature \"Master.\" All animals were equal.\\nOne day in early summer Squealer ordered the sheep to follow him, and\\nled them out to a piece of waste ground at the other end of the farm,\\nwhich had become overgrown with birch saplings. The sheep spent the\\nwhole day there browsing at the leaves under Squealer\\'s supervision. In\\nthe evening he returned to the farmhouse himself, but, as it was warm\\nweather, told the sheep to stay where they were. It ended by their\\nremaining there for a whole week, during which time the other animals\\nsaw nothing of them. Squealer was with them for the greater part of\\nevery day. He was, he said, teaching them to sing a new song, for\\nwhich privacy was needed.\\nIt was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when the\\nanimals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm\\nbuildings, that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard.\\nStartled, the animals stopped in their tracks.

Word had gone round during\\nthe day that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had a strange\\ndream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other\\nanimals. It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as\\nsoon as Mr. Jones was safely out of the way.
